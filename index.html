      <p>My name is Gerald CELESTIN I was born in fonds des Blancs south of Haiti and grew up in the Capital of Port-au-Prince, I am married to a beautiful wife name Daphnée B. CELESTIN and we have two handsome boys I like eating rice, eggs with bananas, Pizza which is Pizza Creole called Paté Chodyè, and drinking juice. I dislike eating cereals. During my childhood, I had the chance to be part of a big world organization Scouting when I was a young boy a make the chance to practice religion Catholic, I was an Altar boy. This organization made me cultivate values that help me forge my personality in Community.</p>
      <p>I had the chance to do a full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ in 2003-2005 and I have served at many levels in the church. I have been called the president of the Sunday school, a member of the High Council, and a counselor in Bishopric's many wards in Haiti. So, now I am serving as a member of the High Council of the Port-au-Prince stake, North Haiti.</p>
      <p>my professional ambitions in this field of computer networking are really big because I want to become one of the best people in my native country to be at a very advanced level in this field so that I can teach this in the universities of my country. But I see that I have a love for databases so I think I will learn a little bit about both areas very interesting. So, I want to make a career in computer networking.</p>
