    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My purpose is to make your job easier and to help you make your research as easy as possible. And help you understand how you can manage HTML and CSS to embed in the site to appear like beauty. So. one of the things we can keep in mind it's when you go to the site you must
       see the work made for someone who passes a lot of time to help you understand their work so, remember that HTML sitemaps are designed specifically for website visitors. They provide an overview of the most important sub-pages of a website. So that it makes your professional life easier and gives you the possibility to communicate with others in a very virtual and acceptable language. Navigate without a problem by doing research that can help you in your professional life and it helps you to improve your intellectual level. In the 18 th century to be able to communicate and make messages pass was a little complicated but in the 60 words of mouth was the best advertising, know that the purpose of a website for a company today is the same. Except instead of Roberto telling Celestin telling Bryan telling Daphnee, it's Google and SEO techniques that load the most relevant sites to your searches on the first page. But that's awesome, right?

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is to prepare  a public event, such as a play, movie, concert, or meeting.My audience is to prepare a public event, such as a play, movie, concert, or meeting. There are mainly 3 forms of the audience, in my very important site plan:
      The useful audience is the part that belongs to your target the precise research on names and targets. The cumulative audience measures the proportion of listeners in contact at least once with the media during a given period. That is, the date of expiry is very important in your research. And the deduplicated audience corresponds to the number of unique individuals reached at least once by your message broadcast on several media. We had the chance to target all the people who are attracted by my site. So thanks to the data collected, I was able to realize that my audience should set all the people among others on the number of visits, the number of pages viewed is very important, and/or the average duration of sessions on this site there is not a limit nor also limits to leave your comments, it is through what you leave as a comment I can know the behavior of my visitors over a period of time and optimize my marketing campaigns to boost your sales the site has everyone who wanted a page to make Marketing for your business, etc.
