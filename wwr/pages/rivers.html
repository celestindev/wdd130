                        the
                        infamous, class IV Mad Mile? The water is highest early in the season, then tapers off as the
                        summer
                        progresses. <br>Looking for a mellower ride? Check out the upper Gallatin any time or the Lower
                        Gallatin later in the summer. Our Gallatin River office is located on Highway 191 between
                        Bozeman
                        and Big Sky, north of West Yellowstone. This is where you will meet for our Gallatin or Madison
                        River Trips.
