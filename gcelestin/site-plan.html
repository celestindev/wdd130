      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this website is to share with you guys how much is very important Nowadays talking about value and morality is a very important thing to make balance in a world that seems a little disturbed. You will also find some step-by-step guides on how to teach them with your family and children in whatever your past. The objective is to educate and inform you about the moral things that will help you turn to the path that leads you to the eternal life that Jesus Christ our Savior promised to people who follow our God. So, we must be persistent and firm on the path that leads us to return to live in the Celestial Kingdom. One thing is for certain: the more fundamental question of the relationships between morality and the law is outside the scope of this communication. We will see and comprehend that morality appears in various forms in the motivation of life decisions, particularly judicial decisions. As a result, the value reflects a thing or person's qualitative, financial, symbolic, or quantitative value. In the modern scriptures written by ancient prophets living in the continent of America, there is a prophet from the book of Mormon that I love very much Moroni said something very important I will share it with you: Moroni 8:3-4 he said:” 3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite agoodness and bgrace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end.
        4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should disputations rise among you”.
