    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My goal for this site is to share with you how important it is nowadays, to talk about perseverance and about
      value and morals which is a very important thing to make balance in a world that seems a bit disturbed.
      As this is a site that will talk about perseverance and morality and value, I think that people who are looking
      for comfort and want to persevere in earthly things and spiritual things can come to my site they will find some
      comfort.
      I think that all visitors will expect questions that will create excitement in them that and keep them focused on
      the site such as: What do I have to do to be successful in my life? How can I acquire marital values? What is it
      to be moral?
      One of the best activities that the visitor wants to complete on my site is to educate and inform you about the
      moral things that will help you turn to the path that leads you to the eternal life that Jesus Christ our Savior
      promised to people who follow our God
      The first information that is necessary to perform the actions proposed by my site is that this person should
      recognize the good and the bad. And he should know when a person does something wrong there is always a
      consequence that comes with it.
      The idea of visiting my site rather than another to get information or take actions is simple. I have to say that
      in life there are two things that allow all men to stay alive and have hope in this life. First is to recognize
      that there is good and bad while we live on this earth, we do good and bad things for sure. But when we do bad
      things, God punishes us in some way and the bad things we do prevent us from returning to live in the presence of
      God. And every Human not to say 70 percent believe in a God who gives eternal life so we should find a way to
      purify ourselves and make us qualified to return to the presence of Our God. So, this is where my site comes in
      because you will find things that will keep you connected to God and spiritual things.
      You will also find some step-by-step guides on how to teach them with your family and children in whatever your
      past. The objective is to educate and inform you about the moral things that will help you turn to the path that
      leads you to the eternal life that Jesus Christ our Savior promised to people who follow our God. So, we must be
      persistent and firm on the path that leads us to return to live in the Celestial Kingdom. One thing is for
      certain: the more the fundamental question of the relationships between morality and the law is outside the scope
      of this communication. We will see and comprehend that morality appears in various forms in the motivation of life
      decisions, particularly judicial decisions. As a result, the value reflects a thing or person's qualitative,
      financial, symbolic, or quantitative value. In the modern scriptures written by ancient prophets living in the
      continent of America, there is a prophet from the book of Mormon that I love very much Moroni said something very
      important I will share with you: Moroni 8:3-4 said:” 3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually
      praying
      unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite goodness and grace, will
      keep you through the endurance of faith in his name to the end. 4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning
      that which grieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should disputations rise among you”?

      Perseverance comes with the verb persevere in the definition of the word perseverance which means to remain firm
      in one's commitment to be faithful to God's commandments despite the temptations of opposition and adversity. In
      Matthew 10:22 he who endures to the end will be saved.

    <h3>Value</h3>
    <p>
      According to the Bible which is the word of God: Virtue has been defined as the spiritual energy that the believer
      needs to reach the Celestial glory. So glory and virtue are both fruits of God's calling. In 2 Peter 1:3, Is He
      not the One who has called us by glory and virtue
